"""
Time complexity: O( |E| + |V| )
Space complexity: O( |V| ) -> For visited array

A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.

Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all paths
will be of finite length. Now let S be the longest path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest
path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v, if this situation had occurred then S would not
have been the longest path
=> indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0
